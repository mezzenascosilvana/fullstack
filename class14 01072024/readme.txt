POST method fixed
6 days ago | 07/01/2024
Hi Guys, I forgot to add theresponse.end();in the very end of the createServer Scope also, for some reason , the POST method was blocked by the browser I'm using so I had to force allow using the code below response.writeHead(200, {    "Content-Type": "application/json",    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "*",    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "*",  });anyway I'm sending the code for your consideration in near future we are going to learn a much easier way to do the same, be hold thanks
